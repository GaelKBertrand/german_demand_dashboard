   DATA LOADER  —  builds the full in-browser DATA model from a sector CSV.
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Loading is done with an explicit fetch() (NOT PapaParse download:true) so we
   can:
     • check the real HTTP status (404 = file not at that path in the repo),
     • strip a UTF-8 BOM (Excel-exported CSVs add one; it corrupts the first
       header name and silently drops every row),
     • auto-detect a ',' vs ';' delimiter (German exports often use ';'),
     • match column names case-/format-insensitively (Job_Title == job title),
   and hand back precise diagnostics instead of a misleading "test locally"
   message. The aggregation core is unchanged and still emits the structures the
   render engine consumes, PLUS ISCO-4 codes and per-code classification tables.

     DATA = {
       lookup:  { states[], isic[], isco4[], empTypes[], weekLabels[] },
       rows:    [[state, isic, isco2, isco3, isco4, emp, genuine, week], ...],

       roleTable:    [ {isco3, name, count, ptPct, topEmp, topState}, ... ],
       isco3Table:   [ {code, name, count, pct}, ... ],            // ALL ISCO-3
